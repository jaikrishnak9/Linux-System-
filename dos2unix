dos2unix is a linux package 

Purpose - when you try to run "install.sh" if you see an error "install.sh" not found and the same repeated many times means "install.sh" is 
created in dos format which is not compatible to unix format. To find more descriptive error run install.sh using "sudo bash install.sh". Then
you will see a error '\r': command not found.
So first "install.h" need to be converted to unix format. "dos2unix" package helps in this situation.

So, first install dos2unix package then convert install.sh to unix format. run "dos2unix install.sh"
